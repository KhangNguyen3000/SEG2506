<p><u>Visualize ids or names</u></p>
<p><u><br>
</u>The labels associated with places and transitions are initially set to display their identifiers, but usually the user will find it more useful to change the label to display a more meaningful name. The current feature provides an easy way to switch from names to identifiers and back. By clicking on this <img border="0" src="HISIM%20images/visualize%20ids%20or%20names.png">&nbsp;icon in the toolbar, all labels that are currently displayed will show the component's ids instead of the user-assigned names or, if they are currently showing ids, the label will switch back to names.</p>
