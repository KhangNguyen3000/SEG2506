<p><u>Step forward to next event</u></p>
<p><u><br>
</u>To run the next event in the simulation, you can click on this <img border="0" src="HISIM%20images/step%20forward%20to%20next%20event.png" width="27" height="27">&nbsp; icon in the toolbar, i.e. fire the transition that is nearest in time. If there are immediate transitions enabled, they will be fired and no time will pass. Otherwise, for transitions that are enabled, the nearest in time to fire (in terms of their delays) will be the one which will actually fire. Of course multiple transitions can fire at the same time. The amount of time to the next event can vary, as transitions can have different delays.</p>
