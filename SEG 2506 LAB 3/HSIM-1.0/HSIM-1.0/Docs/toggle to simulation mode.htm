<p><u>Toggle to simulation mode</u></p>
<p>HISim can be in two modes, Draw or Simulation. While editing a Petri net, it can't be simulated, and viceversa. To switch between the two modes you can click on this <img border="0" src="HISIM%20images/toggle%20to%20simulation%20mode.png" width="27" height="27">&nbsp;icon in the toolbar, or select the Simulation mode in the Simulate menu.</p>
<p>HISIm checks the structure of the Petri net before switching to Simulation mode, generating a list of errors and warnings that are displayed in a list on a pop-up window. By selecting an entry in the list, the corresponding arc will be highlighted in the editor. If errors are found, you won't be allowed into Simulation mode, and when closing the pop-up window, you will be back in Draw mode. If only warnings are found, when closing the pop-up window you will be in Simulation mode.</p>
<p>Errors appear when forbidden combinations of elements are found in the Petri net. Please see the corresponding section in the help relative to "Editing and Visualizing Petri nets".</p>
