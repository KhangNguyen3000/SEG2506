<p><u>Restore initial marking</u></p>
<p>To restore the initial marking, you can click on this <img border="0" src="HISIM%20images/restore%20initial%20marking.png">&nbsp;icon in the toolbar. Every time you save a Petri net, the current marking is stored together with the net's structure, and that's the marking that is going to be restored when you use the current feature.</p>
