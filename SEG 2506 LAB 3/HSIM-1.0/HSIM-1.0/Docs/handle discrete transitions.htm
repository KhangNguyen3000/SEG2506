<p><u>Handle a Discrete Transition</u></p>
<p>When a discrete transition is enabled, it will fire as soon as possible, i.e. once its delay has passed. An enabled transition that is waiting for its delay to pass can become disenabled as the net's markings change, i.e. HISim does not handle reserved tokens. If the Delay property has a 0 value, it represents an immediate transition, and a value of -1 represents a delay equal to the Sample Time simulation parameter (see the Parameters option in the Simulate menu).
<p>To add a discrete transition you can click on this <img border="0" src="HISIM%20images/add%20a%20discrete%20transition.png" width="27" height="27">&nbsp;icon in the toolbar, or select the Discrete Transition option in the Draw menu. Then left clicking at any position in the drawing area a new discrete transition will be created there.</p>
<p>To change the properties of a discrete transition, you can right click on it and then select an option in the pop-up menu.</p>
