<p><u>Simulation conflicts</u></p>

<p>HISim allows you to build a net with structural conflicts. If effective conflicts occur during the simulation of a Petri net, they will be detected and transitions will be fired "in order" i.e. in the order established by their identifiers. Therefore when the turn comes for a certain transition in a conflict to fire, there might not be enough tokens left in the input place and the transition wouldn't fire.</p>
<p>When switching to Simulation mode, the net is checked for possible inconsistencies and a pop-up window is displayed with a list of errors and warnings. Structural conflicts will appear in the list as warnings and by selecting the corresponding entry in the list, the associated arc will be highlighted in the editor.</p>
