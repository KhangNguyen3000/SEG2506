<title>Set simulation parameters</title>

<p><u>Set simulation parameters</u></p>
<p>You can set the simulation parameters selecting the "Parameters" option in the Simulation menu. These parameters are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Simulation time: total amount of time in seconds for the simulation. Once the simulation has run for this amount of time, it will stop.</li>
  <li>Sample time: amount of time that will pass at each simulation step. The delay for both discrete and continuous transitions -in the latter case representing the step of integration- can be made equal to the sample time by giving it a -1 value.</li>
  <li>Simulation speed: real amount of time that corresponds to a unit of simulated time. For values <1, the simulation will run slower that the events it represents. For values >1, it will run faster.</li>
</ul>
