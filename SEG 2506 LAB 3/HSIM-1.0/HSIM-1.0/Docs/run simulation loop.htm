<p><u>Run simulation loop</u></p>
<p>To run events continuously, you can click on this <img border="0" src="HISIM%20images/run%20simulation%20loop.png" width="27" height="27">&nbsp;icon in the toolbar, or select the "Run Simulation" option in the Simulate menu. Continuous time is discretized in time intervals (of Sample Time seconds, see simulation parameters), and at every time interval, all events that are due to happen in that time frame will be run. Running a simulation loop is equivalent to repetitively clicking on the "Run Next Event" icon in terms of the evolution of the Petri net marking, the difference being that in the simulation loop, a simulation step always takes the same amount of time (Sample Time), while in "Run Next Event" it will depend on what's the next event, and can vary from on step to the next.</p>
