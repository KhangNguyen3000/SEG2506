<p><u>Handle a Continuous Transition</u></p>
<p>Continuous transitions are always enabled, and the transport of continuous amout to the output places is made according to its firing function, which can be a constant or a function of the markings of the input places. Like discrete transitions, continuous transitions have a Delay property, that represents the step of integration, therefore the smaller the delay, the more accurate the aproximation to the continuous firing function. A value of -1 for the delay again represents a delay equal to the Sample Time simulation parameter (see the Parameters option in the Simulate menu).
<p>To add a continuous transition you can click on this <img border="0" src="HISIM%20images/add%20a%20continuous%20transition.png" width="27" height="27">&nbsp;icon in the toolbar, or select the Continuous Transition option in the Draw menu. Then left clicking at any position in the drawing area a new continuous transition will be created there.</p>
<p>To change the properties of a continuous transition, you can right click on it and then select an option in the pop-up menu.</p>
